# Europa
Europa is a sandbox environment that runs [`FRAME Contracts pallet`](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/smart-contracts/contracts-pallet), 
and it is also a framework that provides a sandbox environment for [substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/) runtime. 
Europa could be used to simplify the developing, debugging, and integration test when developers develop Substrate 
runtime pallets and test smart contract (like [ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink), [ask!](https://github.com/patractlabs/ask) and [Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang)) for `FRAME Contracts pallet`. 

* **As the framework for Substrate runtime**

    When regarding this project as a lib framework, this sandbox framework already removes WASM executor, p2p, 
    consensus functions and other unnecessary parts, **just remaining the native execution environment and RPC interface**. 

    Europa sandbox framework also provides a local database, a concept of workspaces which isolates different developing environments. 

* **As the sandbox for `FRAME Contracts pallet` module for debugging and testing contracts**

    When regarding this project as an executable file which is used for running contracts, Europa provides more detail and richer
    information and wasm panic backtrace for executing contracts. This information is very useful to help developers 
    to locate the bugs and errors in contracts, especially for the cases which multiple contracts call each other in a
    complex way, like defi or else.
    And in the future, We may build it as an electron app to allow developers to download and run directly.

Riot Group for discussion: https://app.element.io/#/room/#PatractLabsDev:matrix.org

**Note: Currently, `FRAME Contracts pallet(pallet-contract)` is under developing, which may contain some breaking changes. 
Thus we use different branch to distinguish different `FRAME Contracts pallet` version.**

*Note: We name `FRAME Contracts pallet` as `pallet-contract` in following doc.*

We provide three main branches now:

* `master`: run newest `pallet-contracts` on newest substrate dependencies now.
* `substrate/v3.0.0`: run substrate-v3.0.0 `pallet-contracts` based on v3.0.0 substrate dependencies.
* `substrate/v2.0.0`: run substrate-v2.0.0 `pallet-contracts` based on v2.0.0 substrate dependencies.

In those branch:

* `master` branch is our default branch, which provides our forked `pallet-contracts` crate that tracks the newest substrate `pallet-contracts` module.

    In `master` branch, Europa use `vender/substrate`'s `pallet-contracts` as dependency. This forked `pallet-contracts` is from 
    the branch `europa-contracts` in our `vendor/substrate` repo. In this forked `pallet-contracts` Europa provides 
    many self test features.
    
    More information about this forked substrate refers to [this repo](https://github.com/patractlabs/substrate)
    
    Currently, the tracked substrate commit is [deac6324a16fc4128b94a7b4c3826eebcb86917f](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/commit/deac6324a16fc4128b94a7b4c3826eebcb86917f)

* `substrate/v3.0.0` branch is fixed in v3.0.0 substrate:

    In this branch, Europa use substrate v3.0.0 from crate.io as dependencies, so as the `pallet-contracts` in vendor.

* `substrate/v2.0.0` branch is fixed in v2.0.0 substrate and does not contains vendor:

    > P.S. We do not advice you to use v2.0.0, for we no longer maintain this version.

For master, Europa is tracking [newest substrate (deac6324)](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/commit/deac6324a16fc4128b94a7b4c3826eebcb86917f) now. 
Thus, `pallet-contracts` can use the newest features.

## Extending types
When using [Substrate Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps), [@polkadot/api](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) and [Redspot](https://github.com/patractlabs/redspot) or other 3rd parties clients to connect Europa `pallet-contracts` node, please remember to add ["extending types"](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.extend/) for Europa requirements.

Europa **current** "extending types" is (This may be changed for different Europa version):
```json
{
  "LookupSource": "MultiAddress",
  "Address": "MultiAddress",
  "AliveContractInfo": {
    "trieId": "TrieId",
    "storageSize": "u32",
    "pairCount": "u32",
    "codeHash": "CodeHash",
    "rentAllowance": "Balance",
    "rentPaid": "Balance",
    "deductBlock": "BlockNumber",
    "lastWrite": "Option<BlockNumber>",
    "_reserved": "Option<Null>"
  }
}
```

## Features
In details, current Europa sandbox framework provides:
1. This framework is another implementation for [substrate client](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/client).

    Europa client crates are named `ec-*`, for Substrate client crates are named `sc-*`. Thus, Europa sandbox framework could also be used by any blockchain projects which are based on Substrate.
    
    The directory `bin/europa` is the implementation example for Europa like [`bin/node`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/bin/node), [`bin/node-template`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/bin/node-template) in Substrate. Substrate blockchain could integrate Europa framework for following features.  

2. Producing a block only when receive new extrinsic.
3. Removing all WASM related parts.
4. Providing another database called `state-kv` to records every block modified state.
5. Providing some particular rpc to operate this sandbox.
    * `europa_forwardToHeight`: developer can call this rpc to auto generate empty blocks to pointed height. 
    * `europa_backwardToHeight`: developer could revert block height and states to pointed height.
    * ...
    
6. Use workspace to isolate different node environment.

More information about sandbox framework detailed features refers to the doc: [basic.md](./doc/basic.md)

And for Europa `pallet-contracts` sandbox, we split into two parts:

Europa self modifications:

- [x] Using `ep-sandbox` instead of `sp-sandbox` in `pallet-contracts`.
    - [x] Using [`forked wasmi`](https://github.com/patractlabs/wasmi) to support **WASM panic backtrace**.
    - [X] Using `wasmtime` as WASM JIT-executor
    - [ ] Support gdb/lldb debug. (developing)
    - [ ] Using `wasm3` as a more faster WASM interpreter. (not in plan)
- [x] Supporting `NestedRuntime` event track feature to record all useful thing in `pallet-contracts`.
    When instantiate or call a contract (This contract needs to be compiled by [PatractLabs's `cargo-contract`](https://github.com/patractlabs/cargo-contract/) now), Europa would print:
    
    ```bash
    1: NestedRuntime {
        ext_result: [success] ExecReturnValue { flags: 0, data: 01 },
        caller: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (5C4hrfjw...),

        selector: 0x1e5ca456,
        args: None,
        value: 0,
        gas_limit: 4999999999999,
        gas_left: 4998334662707,
        env_trace: [
            seal_value_transferred(Some(0x00000000000000000000000000000000)),
            seal_input(Some(0x1e5ca456)),
            seal_get_storage((Some(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000), Some(0x01))),
            seal_return((0, Some(0x01))),
        ],
        trap_reason: TrapReason::Return(ReturnData { flags: 0, data: 01 }),
        nest: [],
    }
    ```

- [ ] `pallet-contracts` self features.
    For now, Europa is tracing the version before 4.0.0-dev(commit [deac6324a16fc4128b94a7b4c3826eebcb86917f](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/commit/deac6324a16fc4128b94a7b4c3826eebcb86917f)).
    
    Thus, the recent feature: "contracts: Allow contracts to dispatch calls into the runtime ([#9276](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9276))" can support.
    This feature and the following modifications will be merged **after substrate release 4.0.0**.
  
ChainExtensions features:

- [x] Contract Logger support, refer to this link [PIP-102](https://github.com/patractlabs/PIPs/blob/main/PIPs/pip-102.md)
- [x] Zero-Knowledge support, refer to this link [PIP-101](https://github.com/patractlabs/PIPs/blob/main/PIPs/pip-101.md)

  *Currently we use a simple static way to charge weight for ZKP, we would change this part with benchmarks result in future.*

## Plan
1. v0.1: Have an independent runtime environment to facilitate more subsequent expansion directions. (finish)

    The independent runtime environment of excluded nodes can be expanded more without the constraints of the node environment and WASM compilation, and can be easily integrated with other components. In this version, it is more like simulating the Ganache project in Ethereum ecosystem, enabling contract developers to develop without having to build a contract blockchain. Developers can quickly fire up a personal Substrate chain, which can be used to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.

2. v0.2: Modify at contract module level to provide more information. (finish)

    In this version, we will fork the pallet-contracts module for secondary development. We will strengthen the part of the error notification for contract developers, such as providing:
    * WASM stack traces, the function call stack during WASM contract execution;
    * Contracts stack traces, the call stack of a contract calling another contract;
    * Console.log, provides libraries and methods to print command lines during contract development;
    * Strengthen the error type and error display of the contract module;
    * Simple integration with Redspot; (not yet)
    
3. v0.3: Improve the development experience, strengthen collaboration with other tools, and extend the sandbox to be compatible with other runtime modules. (in future)

    * Strengthen the integration with Redspot
    * Strengthen the integration with polkadot.js.org/apps to achieve complete RPC support
    * Support status data query
